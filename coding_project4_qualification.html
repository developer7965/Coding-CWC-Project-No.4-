	<center><h1>The Various Qualification Processes of the Cricket World Cup</h1></center>
	<center><h2>Auto-Qualification</h2></center>
	<br>
	<p>From the first World Cup in 1975 up to the 2019 World Cup, the majority of teams taking part qualified automatically. Until the 2015 World Cup this was mostly through having Full Membership of the ICC, and for the 2019 World Cup this was mostly through ranking position in the ICC ODI Championship.</p>
	<br>
	<center><h2><i>Other</i> Qualification Processes</h2></center>
	<br>
	<p>Since the second World Cup in 1979 up to the 2019 World Cup, the teams that qualified automatically were joined by a small number of others who qualified for the World Cup through the qualification process. The first qualifying tournament being the ICC Trophy; later the process expanding with pre-qualifying tournaments. For the 2011 World Cup, the ICC World Cricket League replaced the past pre-qualifying processes; and the name "ICC Trophy" was changed to "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Cup_Qualifier">ICC World Cup Qualifier</a>". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cricket_League">The World Cricket League</a> was the qualification system provided to allow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_International_Cricket_Council_members#Associate_Members">Associate</a> and <abbr title="A previous membership type, removed in June 2017(All Affiliate Members became Associate Members)" id="one">Affiliate</abbr> members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify. The number of teams qualifying varied throughout the years.</p>
	<br>
	<center><h2>Future Qualification Processes</h2></center>
	<br>
	<p>From the 2023 World Cup onwards, only the host nation(s) will qualify automatically. All other countries will participate in a series of leagues to determine qualification, with automatic promotion and relegation between divisions from one World Cup cycle to the next.</p>
